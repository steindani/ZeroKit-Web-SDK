# ZeroKit Web SDK
This SDK helps you implement **secure authentication** and **end-to-end encryption** in your web application, utilizing only iframes loaded from a tenant server. These iframes deal with password inputs and run all the code handling encryption keys, protecting you from accindental leaks and most XSS attacks.

The ZeroKit SDK for Web is currently under development and accessible as a preview. We continuously improve the SDK and fix bugs. The project is developed in TypeScript and available as a compiled JavaScript file from the tenant server. Loading from there is the recommended way of use.

## Usage
The SDK compiles into a bundle, inserting the zkit_sdk object into the global namespace. Calling the `setup` method of this object initializes the SDK. This should be done during the pageload â€“ optionally along with a `whoAmI` call that initializes the lazy loading. After that your application can use the exposed `login`, `register`, and alike methods.

For a detailed documentation, please visit the [tenant management portal](https://manage.tresorit.io).

## Requirements
First, to use the SDK you need a tenant server (basically a subscription to ZeroKit). You can get one for free at the ZeroKit [tenant management portal](https://manage.tresorit.io), where you can also find a detailed documentation and sample apps for many platforms. You can also take a look at the relevant example at our [ZeroKit simple example GitHub repo](https://github.com/tresorit/ZeroKit-simple-example).
